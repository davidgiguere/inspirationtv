Part workplace inspiration device, part retro techno-art project

The Inspiration Machine aka Inspiration TV was built using a thrift store Sony MEGA Watchman (gutted and modified, except for the dials, buttons, etc. necessary for a factory appearance) cabinet housing a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, Gowoops 5V 2A Power Adapter Micro USB Cable with On/Off Switch adapted to fit the original Watchman location and Elecrow RPA05010R HDMI 5-Inch 800x480 TFT LCD Display. The Chromium browser is started in Full Screen mode on boot, with a refresh script reloading content from the Inspiration TV Tumblr account I created for the project found here: https://inspirationtv.tumblr.com/. Every 15 seconds, a randomized quote is displayed from the 200+ quotes found using the https://inspirationtv.tumblr.com/random URL. 

Feel free to use the Tumblr quotes page in your own projects. 

Cheers,
David
